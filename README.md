## Instructions
This Challenge is divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

## Data Modeling
Inspect the CSV files, and then sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables. To create the sketch, feel free to use a tool like QuickDBDLinks to an external site..

## Data Engineering
  1.  Use the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Be sure to do the following:
    -  Remember to specify the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
    -  For the primary keys, verify that the column is unique. Otherwise, create a composite keyLinks to an external site., which takes two primary keys to uniquely identify a row.
    -  Be sure to create the tables in the correct order to handle the foreign keys.

  2.  Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.
